        "We can also consider changing the orientation of faces. We can search for other suitable repos in this regard. Rotation and other similar augmentation methods have been used a lot in the previous works, and I think only applying those data augmentation methods may not be a novelty. Therefore, I think working on novel data augmentation approaches might be better and in this way we have something good to present, even if the results will not be satisfactory enough (because at least we are trying novel approaches to handle face recognition, e.g after years and in different conditions)."
